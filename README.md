# controlEscolar
This is a software that simulate a school control program. You can register students, teachers, classes, majors, etc...  ItÂ´s for my software engineering class.
Hey! What's up! I'm Naokko (Diego Escalante) the developer behind this software. In the repository you can find all that you need to make this thing work. Maybe you'll need a few libraries like tkinter or sql, but besides that all you need is here :)
